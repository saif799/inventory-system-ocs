/**
 * A full-bleed photograph and one line of poster type. Nothing else.
 *
 * Static — no DB, no hero table (see ADR-0002, superseding ADR-0001 §1).
 *
 * What was removed, and why it is not coming back piecemeal: the badge, the
 * localised h1, the "vérifiée avant expédition" subtitle, two CTAs and the
 * tagline. The delivery promise in particular is now stated in exactly three
 * places (the authenticity band, the trust band, the FAQ) instead of four, and
 * the hero is the one screen that has to sell the brand rather than explain the
 * logistics. `hero.title` survives in the catalogs because the sr-only line
 * below still uses it — it is the only localised, keyword-bearing sentence on
 * this screen, and dropping it would take the Arabic/French homepage h1 with it.
 *
 * ART DIRECTION — two different photographs, not one image cropped twice: the
 * desktop frame is a wide court shot that has nothing left in a 9:16 crop, the
 * mobile frame is a portrait product shot. That is what <picture> is for, and
 * it is why this is not a next/image: `images.unoptimized` is set in
 * next.config.mjs, so <Image> would ship the full-size original and, with two
 * of them, download both. <picture> media queries fetch exactly one.
 *
 * TWO HEIGHT MODELS, one per frame, because the two photographs want opposite
 * things and an earlier single `h-[100svh]` + object-contain served neither —
 * it letterboxed the phone crop in black bands.
 *
 *   - Phone: the section has no height of its own. The <img> is in normal flow
 *     at `w-full h-auto` and the type is an absolute overlay, so the frame is
 *     the 9:16 photo's own aspect ratio: nothing cropped, nothing padded, and
 *     the hero ends a little above the fold on a tall handset.
 *   - md and up: `h-[100svh]`, the img absolute and `object-cover`. The desktop
 *     frame is 3:2 against a ~16:9 viewport, so covering trims a few percent
 *     off the top and bottom of a shot that has room to lose there — the cost
 *     of a hero that is exactly one screen, which is the point of it.
 *
 * `bg-black` survives only as the ground under a photo that has not decoded.
 *
 * The files under public/hero are derivatives; the originals live in
 * assets/hero/ (outside public/, so 4 MB of source is neither served nor
 * deployed). Regenerate after replacing a source photo:
 *
 *   sharp(src).resize({ width: w }).webp({ quality: 68, effort: 6 })
 *   // desktop w = 1280 / 1920 / 2560, mobile w = 640 / 828 / 1200 at q72,
 *   // plus one .jpg fallback each (desktop 1600, mobile 828) at q76.
 */

/**
 * Fixed English, in both locales, on purpose. It is a wordmark, not copy: the
 * face that draws it (Anton, see .sf-poster) has no Arabic glyphs, so an
 * Arabic translation here would silently fall back to a different font at
 * 100px. The localised sentence lives in the sr-only line instead.
 *
 * Three fragments, not two, because each one takes its own line at every
 * width; splitting "for athletes" is what lets the stack break after "for".
